# FitTrainerBasic  
  
This will be an Android project based on new Database components from Android.  
The goal for this project is to utilize Android’s new Room and LifeCycle components in a fun and useful way.  
This project will serve as a base for a Premium application I will launch in the future.  
The basic goals of this application are to allow the user to create an “Exercise” along with selecting a Muscle group, save the Exercise to their local device, be able to Edit/Update the Exercise and view a List of Exercises on the Home Screen.  
  
## Goals for 0.1.0  
  
- [ ] Home Activity with View Pager and Two Tabs “Workouts” and “Exercises”  
- [ ] Exercise and Workout Fragment that are used in Home Activity Pager  
- [ ] Exercise Adapter, ViewHolder and Local Exercise Object for RecyclerView.  
- [ ] Exercise Room, DAO and SQL Repository for persisting data.  
- [ ] Edit Exercise Fragment/New Exercise Fragment where new Exercise is created or saved.  
- [ ] Delete Exercise on Swipe with Alert to warn user of delete process.  
  
## TidBits  
  
The build has Android Wear. If I can reach 1.0, I will add a Wear App for a user to “Start” a workout and step through it, along with the ability to add Exercise images (Up to 3) so they can create an Exercise Animated image.
